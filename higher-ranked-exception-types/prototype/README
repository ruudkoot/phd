== BUILDING ====================================================================

The application can be build using the command:

    $ cabal install

We have only tested this with GHC 7.8.


== RUNNING =====================================================================

Launch the executable ./dist/build/prototype/prototype.

This will start a webserver than can be accessed via:

    http://localhost:8000/hret/inference
    

Type a program in the text box, or load one of the supplied examples by clicking
on them. Hit the "Submit Quert" button. The infered exception type, elaborated
program and two derivation trees (declarative type system and syntax-directed
elaboration) will be printed.

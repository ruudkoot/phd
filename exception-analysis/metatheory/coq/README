This directory contains mechanized Coq proofs to accompany our paper entitled:

Type-based Exception Analysis for Non-strict Higher-order Functional Languages 
with Imprecise Exception Semantics

The paper version of these proofs (and more) are in an addendum to the paper.

Our proofs can be found in ExceptionAnalysis.v. It uses the LibTactics.v [1] and 
SfLib.v [2] that we deliver also in compiled form. Simply open ExceptionAnalysis.v 
in your favorite Coq IDE and run it (we used CoqIdE 8.3pl5).

Further details about our mechanized proofs are in ExceptionAnalysis.v.
